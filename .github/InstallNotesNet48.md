### Install Notes

Just download and run `Fesh.net48-win-Setup.exe` to install.

No admin rights are required to install or run the app.
The app will be installed in `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\Fesh.net48\current`.\
A shortcut will be created on the desktop.\

It will automatically suggest to update Fesh when a new version is released.\
The installer is digitally code-signed via Azure Trusted Signing Service.\
It should not raise any security warnings.

There is also a portable package `Fesh.net48-Portable.zip` which does not need to be installed and is self-updating.\
Feel free to extract your app from that zip and place it wherever you'd like.
